# UX Review - 2026-02-01

## Executive Summary
This review focuses on the immediate user journey from the landing page to the game lobby. While the application functions, there are several "friction points" that may confuse or frustrate first-time users. The highest priority items relate to **error clarity** and **actionable feedback**.

## High Priority Observations & Recommendations

### 1. Ambiguous Error Feedback (Landing Page)
**Observation**: When entering a name that is too long or invalid (e.g., the default generated name "LivelyWhiteFoxAgentUX"), the application displays a generic "Invalid data" toast notification.
**Impact**: Users do not know *why* their input failed. They may think the server is down or the app is broken, rather than realizing they just need a shorter name.
**Recommendation**:
- **Specific Error Messages**: Return precise errors like "Name must be 12 characters or fewer" or "Name cannot contain special characters".
- **Real-time Validation**: If possible, validate the input field as the user types (e.g., max-length attribute or visual character counter).

### 2. "Start Game" Button Unresponsiveness
**Observation**: In the Lobby, the "START GAME" button appears actionable but does nothing if there are fewer than 3 players. The reason is only shown in a browser tooltip (`title` attribute), which is invisible to mobile users and easily missed by desktop users.
**Impact**: The host may repeatedly click the button, believing the app is unresponsive.
**Recommendation**:
- **Visibly Disabled State**: Style the button as disabled (greyed out) until requirements are met.
- **Explicit Instruction**: Display a permanent text or banner in the lobby: "Waiting for players (1/3 joined)" or "Need 3 players to start".
- **Toast on Click**: If the user clicks the disabled/inactive button, show a toast explaining exactly what is missing.

### 3. Redundant "Ready" Step for Host
**Observation**: The Host must click "MARK READY" before they can "START GAME".
**Impact**: Since the Host controls when the game starts, asking them to mark themselves as "ready" is an unnecessary extra click. It adds friction without value.
**Recommendation**:
- **Auto-Ready Host**: The Host should essentially be "always ready" or simply control the start mechanism directly. The "Ready" status is useful for *guests*, but the Host's "Start Game" action implies they are ready.

### 4. Iconography & Invite Visibility
**Observation**:
- The Invite feature is hidden behind a generic phone icon (📱) in the lobby header.
- Inside the invite modal, the "Copy Link" button is an unlabeled icon.
**Impact**: Users may not immediately know how to invite friends. Icons without labels can be ambiguous.
**Recommendation**:
- **Explicit "Invite" Button**: Replace or augment the phone icon with a button labeled "INVITE" or "SHARE CODE".
- **Label the Copy Button**: In the modal, add text "Copy Link" next to the icon to ensure clarity.

### 5. Default Name Issues
**Observation**: The app sometimes pre-fills a name that is itself invalid (too long).
**Recommendation**: Ensure the random name generator adheres to the same validation rules as the backend (e.g., max length).

## Technical Notes
- **Server Port Conflict**: The server defaults to port 3000, which is commonly used. The application crashes if this port is taken. Consider using a dynamic port allocation or a less common default port, or handle `EADDRINUSE` more gracefully.
- **Port**: The application was successfully tested on Client: 5174 / Server: 3002.
